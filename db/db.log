You can\u2019t see or smell these pollutants, but they can come from regular household items. Eek! The EPA estimates indoor air can be up to 1,000 times dirtier than outdoor air! Indoor pollutants can build up and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other illnesses.\u000aAnd since Americans are considered the \u2018Indoor Generation,\u2019 spending most of our time indoors, healthy, clean air quality should be a top priority.\u000aHow Plants Clean Indoor Air\u000aPlants absorb gases through their leaves. That\u2019s how they convert carbon dioxide and light into energy, a process called photosynthesis.\u000aBut that\u2019s not all they absorb. Researchers found that house plants also absorb VOCs, or volatile organic compounds, from the air. VOCs include things like benzene from plastics and fabrics, or formaldehyde found in things such as cleaning products, beauty products, fragrances, dry-cleaned clothes, paraffin wax candles, carpets, and furniture. Plants\u2019 ability to remove these pollutants from our air is extraordinary. They also absorb the carbon dioxide and viruses we exhale. When plants absorb gases through their leaves, it stays sequestered or moves into their roots. Microorganisms that live in the soil, help breakdown and neutralize the toxins before turning them into food.\u000aFilling your home with attractive houseplants is a beautiful step in detoxifying the air. In fact, houseplants make people feel more relaxed and calm while beautifying every room in the house. \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u000aSo now we know how plants clean the air, but it\u2019s important to note that not ALL plants have the air purifying qualities of others!','By Connor','2020-05-19 00:00:00.000000','https://www.plants.com/greenhouse/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-953779982-min.jpg',0,'5 min')

Are you excited by the potential of growing an oasis indoors&nbsp;only to be disappointed by their demise only weeks after bringing them home?</p><p>Owning a <a href="https://www.houseplantgirl.com/best-pet-friendly-plants/">cat and being a plant lover is HARD</a>. They love to chew and gnaw on your precious plants, batting them as if they were toys. No respect for the greenery, cats use them for their own sadistic fun, all the while we have to watch as onlookers, not having enough time to whack the cats away&nbsp;each time they\u2019re caught in the act.</p><p>Not only this, but cats love to use our precious house plants as their new litter box, peeing and defecating in the shrubs as if their shit is gold. It\u2019s not. <strong>It\u2019s gross and ruining my plants.</strong></p><p>Many think you have to choose one or the other, But why can\u2019t you can\u2019t have both?</p><p>I recently caught my cat gnawing on my new baby <a href="http://wp.me/p6SpvR-6f">parlor palm tree</a> and nothing made me scream more than the thought of not seeing my baby plant grow up. I couldn\u2019t believe my luck and all I wanted to know was how to keep my cat out of my house plants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>don\u2019t give up on your plants</h2><p>Here\u2019s the thing,<strong> I am not willing to give up my love for plants just because my cat (who will probably outlive us all) has no respect for the botanic garden I\u2019m trying to create in my home. </strong>I also live in a climate that gets cold and blustery in the winter, where the only sign of life and hope resides in my plants. I\u2019m not willing to give them up.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I adore my cat. I\u2019m obviously not willing to get rid of the little stinker just so I can have some extra oxygen in the household.

This obviously won\u2019t look great, but if it works then I\u2019d say it\u2019s a keeper. Or try and place strips of lint roller tape face up inside your pots. When your cats try and use the soil, they\u2019ll find unpleasant lint tape stuck to them and will think twice about coming back for more!</p><h3><strong>citrus to the rescue</strong></h3><p>Cats hate citrus. Oranges, lemons, limes, they hate them all! Try and place lemon and lime peels throughout your potted plants to keep them away. Experiment and see what works, how much you need and how often you need it. Or, go and get some citrus <a href="http://www.houseplantgirl.com/the-best-essential-oil-brands/">essential oils</a> and place a few drops around the potting soil. You can also place essential oils into the watering can for added citrus magic.</p><h3><strong>grow special plants just for the cats</strong></h3><p>Okay, so nothing seems to be working. It\u2019s time to play by their rules. This tactic uses a couple plants as \u201cofferings\u201d to your cats in order to save the rest of the flock. This idea is fun because you get to plant even more while saving the others. Totally a victim-bait strategy and it works great. Grow some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Catnip-Plant-Nepeta-INSIDE-OUTSIDE/dp/B000PEHBKI/ref=as_li_bk_tl/?tag=polkpunc-20&amp;linkId=28a7814c9cd42cd4016a58f9025eead5&amp;linkCode=ktl">cat- nip</a>, barley&nbsp;or other grasses which will be used as bait. These plants will be fair game\u2014allow your cats to go crazy with them. As long as they have something to munch on, they\u2019ll leave alone the less interesting foilage. This is a win-win situation. And you get more plants!</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?source=bk&amp;t=polkpunc-20&amp;bm-id=default&amp;l=ktl&amp;linkId=28a7814c9cd42cd4016a58f9025eead5&amp;_cb=1466700079195" alt=""></figure><h3><strong>pine cones&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>If you have access to pine cones, this is another good strategy. Place these just underneath the soil, so the rounded edges come curving out. Most cats won\u2019t like the feel or smell of the pine cones and will stay away. Would you like to walk on pinecones? I didn\u2019t think so. Amazingly, you can buy pinecones on amazon, just click the link <a href="http://amzn.to/2oEVkoC">here</a>.</p><h3><strong>cayenne pepper</strong></h3><p>Try sprinkling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/McCormick-Ground-Cayenne-Pepper-14-Ounce/dp/B001PQMJD4/ref=as_li_bk_tl/?tag=polkpunc-20&amp;linkId=2c6961e0b2c567877027444d53b877d9&amp;linkCode=ktl">Cayenne pepper</a>&nbsp;on the leaves of your most beloved houseplants. Most cats will have a complete distaste for such a move on your part, and stay away. I don\u2019t think that many cats have food dreams about cayenne pepper, and the total surprise of a hot and spicy flavor coming from their favorite leaf will make them think twice about eating your plants.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?source=bk&amp;t=polkpunc-20&amp;bm-id=default&amp;l=ktl&amp;linkId=2c6961e0b2c567877027444d53b877d9&amp;_cb=1466700090627" alt=""></figure><h3><strong>fruit and vegetable bags</strong></h3><p>Another idea is to use the net fruit and vegetable bags to cover your soil. Cut the bag into a circle the same size diameter as your pot. Cut a hole in the middle, and place the net all along the top of the dirt. You can tape the sides and make sure that everything is covered. What\u2019s great about this solution is you\u2019re still able to fertilize and water the plant through the netted bag.</p><h3><strong>fake it till you make it</strong></h3><p>Another solution is to give into the idea that you won\u2019t be able to enjoy living and breathing plants as long as your feline friends are still around for the party. That\u2019s okay! Thank the plant gods that we have fake plants. And nowadays we have fake plants that actually LOOK GOOD! Take <a href="http://amzn.to/2kXjd8x">Nearly Naturals</a>, for example. I\u2019m impressed by this company and their approach to making fake plants look real. Gone are the days for hokey looking, embarrassing&nbsp;silk trees. Now is the time when you can be proud of your fake Fig trees. Plus your cat won\u2019t kill it!</p><h3><strong>grow your plants in water</strong></h3><p>For those of you who are sick and tired of coming home after a long day at work only to find your potted plants spewed on the floor and dirt everywhere, why not just transfer some of them into a water? You heard that right, some <a href="http://www.houseplantgirl.com/best-indoor-plants-that-grow-in-water-2/">indoor plants grow in water</a>, and you can switch over a few of your favorites into a vase or mason jar. The process is not that difficult, and hopefully, your cat will stay far away from this boring new presentation, except of course to use it as a water bowl. I\u2019ve done this with a couple of my plants and have found that my cat has little to no interest in them.</p><h2>summary</h2><p>Cats are wonderful pets and plants are wonderful additions to your <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-do-you-keep-your-cats-away-146478">home</a>, but you shouldn\u2019t have to pick one over the other, all you have to do to is get creative and learn to hack the world of simultaneous cat and plant living! Once your cats learn that plants are sacred territory, you can have a household of green, oxygen-rich living. Cats will stay out of your house plants, and you are able to have both.</p><p>Keeping cats out of houseplants is easy, not to mention the added benefit of&nbsp;having your air clean and filtered by your green friends.

INSERT INTO BLOG VALUES(4,'How to give your garden an affordable makeover','<p>The arrival of spring encourages us all to spend more time in our gardens. You\u2019ll often be keen to tidy up and then improve on what you have. Of course, if you had an unlimited budget, you could easily spend a fortune there.</p><p>But most of us simply don\u2019t have such resources.</p><p>So, the key here is \u2018affordable\u2019 \u2013 finding inexpensive ways to add to the look, style and enjoyment you can gain through your garden makeover.</p><h2>FIRST STEPS INTO THE NEW SEASON</h2><p>There are a range of starting tasks to complete before considering making some changes:</p><ul><li>Treating your garden to a spring clean is an obvious starting point \u2013 Like a publisher being handed a manuscript, your first step might be a little \u2018editing\u2019. This means removing \u2013 or perhaps simply relocating to better-suited positions \u2013 those plants that you have noticed have been struggling in recent times.</li><li>Repainting as necessary \u2013 If your fences are looking tired or drab, a couple of coats of a proven dark (many experts choose black) outdoor paint will make them look impressive and also provide an excellent backdrop to show vibrant foliage and colours to best effect. Decking might also appreciate a light pressure wash and a fresh coat of oil. Plants pots and containers can also be refurbished in this way.</li><li>Wash-down other hard surfaces \u2013 Carefully pressure wash stone, concrete or timber; use a light touch to remove surface muck. Depending on the style you have chosen, the same process might refresh your garden furniture.</li><li>Carry out any manageable bush and tree-trimming actions \u2013 Expert help may be needed for taller and broader trees, but removing decayed or damaged branches is one part of the exercise. You might also remove some lower foliage to provide lights for ground plants underneath, or trim into a tidier, cleaner shape.</li></ul><h2>UNDERTAKE SOME REARRANGING</h2><p>There are several inexpensive ways to achieve such improvements:</p><ul><li>Well-established perennial plants have often spread further than you imagined. Many such species can be dug up and moved to a better place. A quick check can confirm which of your plants are also suitable for splitting. These can be divided to create several plants where there once was only one. You might then spread these across a single area, to give a better overall effect, or place them in different parts of your garden where the tidy-up has provided some space.</li><li>If your lawn is a bit straggly around its edges, a simple reshaping can deliver what seems like a major improvement. You might choose a square, rectangle, or circle design, or waves around the edges where borders meet grass. Simply use some string and a few canes to mark your route, and use a spade to edit out the excess. The result will be both sharp and professional-looking! You might even consider adding some stone or brick edging \u2013 either to the lawn or your borders.</li></ul><h2>SPEND A LITTLE FOR GREAT EFFECT</h2><p>If your gardening budget is limited, then consider choosing from the following actions that would best add to your garden:</p><ul><li>Give your garden a proper bio or composted dark mulching \u2013 This delivers a great background to allow your plants to stand out and helps to prevent weed growth. This mulch delivers vital nutrients, and also helps maintain soil temperatures and moisture retention. If you have trees in your lawn, digging a small ring around them and then adding a few inches of mulch adds to the effect.</li><li>Consider adding a veggie patch in an unobtrusive corner \u2013 A few dollars spent now can both save money in the shops later and help the family appreciate the real taste of properly fresh vegetables. It\u2019s not unknown for kids who hate any task involving the garden to adore having their own growing patch!</li><li>An alternative way youngsters can often become involved is if you create a small raised veggie or flower border, which also adds a different aspect to your garden. Cover the current surface (lawn or soil) with a piece of tarp or membrane, build up the outside with cinder blocks or bricks to your chosen level, and then fill with a nutrient-rich soil.</li><li>Break up your lawn with a path \u2013 Or you could add one round the edges between the grass and border. Simply remove grass (or soil), add a membrane to prevent weed growth, and then spread your choice of gravel, stones, wood, or flagstones. Choose a shade that best reflects the planting of your garden.</li><li>Finally, consider adding an internal picket fence to separate specific parts of your garden.</li></ul>','by Bernie Boys','2020-04-01 00:00:00.000000','https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/small-garden-royalty-free-image-584877834-1552576830.jpg',0,'15 min')

If the pot it\u2019s sold in is too small, re-potting is key to good indoor plant care and can even help save a dying plant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>\u000aLeaf and Flower Drop</strong></h3><p>No one likes stress, especially plants. A sign your plant is stressed is dropped leaves and flowers. Stressors include lack of water, overwatering, temperature change, not enough light \u2013you name it. Yellow leaves say \u201cHold off the water. You\u2019re killing me with kindness.\u201d If the problem isn\u2019t water or something else easy to identify, have patience. Plants take time to adapt to new situations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wilting</strong></h3><p>If your plants\u2019 leaves are wilting, they\u2019re saying \u201cPlease water me.\u201d Some plants, like peace lilies, wilt so terribly you\u2019d think it was dead. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just being dramatic and will perk up after a good watering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Stretching</strong></h3><p>We\u2019re not talking about yoga here. In the plant world, that means long and spindly stems. The plants are literally stretching themselves toward the light. Some older leaves may fall off. Check on your plant\u2019s light requirements \u2013 chances are it just needs more light. It could also mean your plant needs pinching \u2013 or pruning. Pinching the top inch of your plant\u2019s stem will encourage it to grow fuller and more beautiful.</p><h3><strong>Salt Build Up</strong></h3><p>Have you noticed white stuff on the side of your pots? As you water and fertilize, salts and other minerals can build up. It may cause foliage tips to turn yellow or brown. Watering your plants in the sink and allowing the water to run through a few times helps flush them out. You can use a scrubbing pad on the outside of the pot. And most houseplants like to be repotted once per year.</p>','By Amna','2020-12-30 00:00:00.000000','https://themodemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/plants-in-natural-dining-room.jpg',0,'5 min')

INSERT INTO BLOG VALUES(6,'The Benefits of Having Plants at Home','<p>Plants are living, breathing organisms. Each has its own temperament, personality, and look. They are beautifying, allow us to nurture something, and let us enjoy the all-too-wonderful results: lush foliage, bright flowers, fresh aromas, and sometimes even fruits. But, they offer even more, there are so many benefits of having plants at home. They clean our air and give rooms life and a sense of calm. Plants make indoor spaces better in every way possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Plants and&nbsp;Personality</strong></h2><p>Happy plant owners are well-matched to their plants. Each plant owner has a certain amount of time and each plant needs a certain amount of care. For instance, busy plant lovers that are stretched for time need stress-free, low-care, sun-loving succulents, like <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/echeveria-succulent-157662?c=succulents">Echeveria</a>, healing <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/aloe-vera-plant-157650?c=succulents">Aloe</a>, and cute <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/aloe-vera-plant-157650?c=succulents">cactus</a>. Succulents take so little and give so much. Homebodies with more time and a desire to create green enclaves for retreat should choose white-flowered <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/peace-lily-plant-157654?c=house-plants">Peace Lily</a>, <a href="https://www.plants.com/c/bonsai-bamboo">artful bonsai</a>, or <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/boston-fern-hanging-plant-157641?c=feng-shui-plants">elegant hanging ferns</a>, which need more water and attention. Colorful flowering plants, like <a href="https://www.plants.com/c/orchid-plants">orchids</a>, or airy sun-loving plants, like silvery <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/olive-tree-177006?c=trees">olive trees</a>, are a good fit for outgoing plant lovers that like to entertain with decorative, plant-filled table tops.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Plants for Cleaner Air</strong></h2><p>Another benefit f having plants at home is that house plants are nature\u2019s best air cleaners. Not only do they provide needed oxygen, but they can remove common indoor air toxins, such as cancer-causing formaldehyde. The best-known studies have been conducted by NASA, including the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study">NASA Clean Air Study</a> where ~30 plants were tested to measure their removal of six airborne toxins (benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene, toluene, and ammonia).<a href="https://www.plants.com/p/fall-mum-177037">Chrysanthemum</a> and<a href="https://www.plants.com/p/peace-lily-plant-157654">Peace Lily</a> (<i>Spathiphyllum</i> hybrid) were the two best air cleaners\u2013cleaning nearly all of the toxins present. But, <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/aloe-vera-plant-157650">Aloe</a>,<a href="https://www.plants.com/p/english-ivy-hanging-plant-157642">English Ivy</a>,<a href="https://www.plants.com/p/pothos-hanging-plant-157639">Pothos</a>, and<a href="https://www.plants.com/p/snake-plant-157646">Snake Plant</a> also showed impressive air-cleaning power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Plants for Flavor</strong></h2><p>Fresh indoor herbs are so much nicer than store-bought, and they are so easy. Line cool, sunny kitchen window sills with pots of Basil, <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/parsley-plant-157698?c=herb-plants">Parsley</a>, <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/oregano-plant-157697?c=herb-plants">Oregano</a>, Rosemary, and <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/oregano-plant-157697?c=herb-plants">Thyme</a>. Keep them lightly irrigated through winter, and snip fresh herbs as you need them. Feed them weekly with a diluted dose of all-purpose water soluble fertilizer. Their aromatic leaves also provide natural fragrance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Plants for Stress Relief</strong></h2><p>Studies show that plant-filled spaces are calming, improve personal wellness, reduce stress, and even boost work productivity. Green leaves are pleasing to the senses. They are a pleasure to look at, provide natural aroma, and even generate calming sounds. Think of leaves falling on a windy fall day or palms and grasses softly rustling a windy seaside. Place a tall <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/majesty-palm-floor-plant-157652">Majesty Palm</a> next to a workspace or favorite reading spot. A window cross breeze is all you need to make your home feel like an oasis. The soothing effect will be immediate. Likewise, catching the fragrance of <a href="https://www.plants.com/c/orchid-plants">orchids</a>, <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/moro-blood-orange-tree-157684">orange blossoms</a>, or <a href="https://www.plants.com/c/herb-plants">herbs </a>as you enter a room is the best aromatherapy, and simply snapping off an <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/aloe-vera-plant-157650?c=succulents">aloe </a>leaf to soothe a burn or scrape will make you glad you planted one.</p><p>Bring <a href="https://www.plants.com/c/feng-shui-plants">feng shui </a>into your home with plants. It is believed that certain plants have an innate positive energy and help naturally strike a balance and bring harmony to your living or work space.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Plants for Functionality</strong></h2><p>House plants can be functional. Floor house plants make some of the prettiest, softest room dividers. Sequestering off a work area or private nook with a collection of tall floor plants, such as <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/fiddle-leaf-fig-floor-plant-157653">Fiddle Leaf Fig</a>, <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/majesty-palm-floor-plant-157652?c=floor-plants">Majesty Palm </a>or <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/money-tree-floor-plant-177003?c=floor-plants">Money Tree</a>, gives instant privacy. Well-placed plants can also make small rooms appear bigger, deeper, and more inviting. A well-placed plant is also a great way to lift a plain piece of furniture or cover an ugly outlet\u2026</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Plants for Pet-Friendly Indoor Greening</strong></h2><p>Plants and pets can coexist beautifully. It\u2019s just a matter of choosing plants that won\u2019t harm your pets and your pets cannot harm. Our tall <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/majesty-palm-floor-plant-157652?c=floor-plants">Majesty Palm</a>, <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/money-tree-floor-plant-177003?c=floor-plants">Money Tree</a>, and <a href="https://www.plants.com/p/olive-tree-177006">Olive Tree</a> are all bold, non-toxic options for the home. Just be sure to cover the soil with stones, shells, or pine cones if your cats or dogs get the urge to dig. Air plants and orchids are also perfectly pet friendly.</p>','by Jessie Keith','2020-09-19 00:00:00.000000','https://cdn10.bostonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/house-plants-social.jpg',0,'15 min')
